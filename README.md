## About Me
I’m **Wine**, a structural biology PhD candidate exploring the frontiers of **time‑resolved crystallography at XFEL** and **molecular simulations** to unravel biomolecular mechanisms at atomic resolution. I thrive on designing and executing experiments at cutting‑edge XFEL facilities, then diving into computational workflows to bring those snapshots to life.

My true passion lies in **AI‑driven workflows**—from automated data collection ,noise to signal ratio reduction and model building to predictive simulations and integrative analyses. I aim to harness machine learning and deep‑learning tools to accelerate discovery, improve reproducibility, and open new frontiers in our understanding of biomolecular machines.

Outside the lab, you’ll find me **hiking nearby mountains** in search of fresh air, **capturing landscapes** through my camera lens at golden hour, or simply **sneaking in a well‑deserved nap** before the next big experiment.
